# My Portfolio

This is my portfolio consisting of projects I have completed as part of my coursework, research, and self-learning.
Below, you will find iPython Notebooks, R Markdown files, SQL scripts, and Java/Python files.

## Contents

- ### Classification 

    - [Determining Customer Loan Eligibility](https://github.com/rk567/DSPortfolio/blob/master/MachineLearning/Classification/loan%20prediction/customer%20loan%20eligibility.ipynb)  Cleaned data, engineered features, and developed several machine learning models to determine which customer is eligible for loan.

    - [Determining Employee Retention](https://github.com/rk567/DSPortfolio/blob/master/MachineLearning/Classification/customer%20retention/Customer%20Retention%20-%20Classification.ipynb) Studied the employee retention problem by exploring a dataset, cleaning it, engineering new features, recruiting appropriate algorithms, and building an efficient classification model using cross-validation.

    - [Performing Mushroom Classification](https://github.com/rk567/DSPortfolio/blob/master/MachineLearning/Classification/mushroom%20classification/SVM%20Demo2.ipynb) Used the UCI Machine Learning Mushroom dataset to understand which features are most indicative of a poisonous mushroom and which types of machine learning models perform best.

    - [Determining Customer Retention using Early Activity](http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~raghav/papers/CSCW_Karumur16.pdf) Engineered features based on early user activity and used regression and survival analysis techniques to develop predictive models.
    
    - [Determining Project popularity on GitHub]() Used regression models to study which projects are likely to gain popularity on GitHub.

    _Classification_algorithms_used: Decision trees, Logistic (L1-Regularized, L2-Regularized), Random forests, Boosted trees, SVM
    _Visualization tools used: Matplotlib, Seaborn, ggplot2

- ### Regression

    - [Predict fair transaction prices of Real-Estate Properties](https://github.com/rk567/DSPortfolio/blob/master/MachineLearning/Regression%20-%20Real%20Estate%20Prices/Predicting_transaction_prices1.ipynb)  Used machine learning algorithms to train several models and determine the best model to predict fair transaction prices of real-estate properties before they are sold.The goal is to come up with a predictive model with a MAE of under $70,000.
    
    - [Predict Newcomer Productivity Based on Prior Experience](http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~raghav/papers/content-king-leadership.pdf) Built predictive models to study the effects of prior experience on newcomer productivity in Wikipedia.

    - [Identify Long-term developers on GitHub]() Used regression models to identify which developers are likely to continue contributing to a software project on GitHub.

    _Regression algorithms used: Linear (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic-Net), Poisson, Negative Binomial (over-dispersed), Random forests Boosted trees, Cox-Proportional Hazards

    _Visualization tools used: Matplotlib, Seaborn, ggplot2
    
- ### Clustering:

    - [Clustering: Customer Segmentation]() Clustered the customers in an online retailer dataset using techniques such as K-Means and PCA.

    _Clustering tools used: PCA, K-Means clustering
    _Visualization tools used: Matplotlib, Seaborn

- ### Statistics And Exploration:

    - [User Personality in Recommender Systems](http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~raghav/papers/Karumur_UMAP16.pdf) Used several statistical techniques to explore the relationship between personality and newcomer retention, level of engagement, activity preferences, and distribution of user activity.

    _Techniques used: t-test, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-test, ANOVA 

- ### Java Coding Problems
- ### SQL Coding Problems
