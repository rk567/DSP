# My Portfolio

This is my portfolio consisting of projects I have completed as part of my coursework, research, and self-learning.
Below, you will find iPython Notebooks, R Markdown files, SQL scripts, and Java/Python files.

- ### Data Science Projects

    -[Regression: Transaction prices of Real-Estate Properties](https://github.com/rk567/DSPortfolio/blob/master/MachineLearning/Regression%20-%20Real%20Estate%20Prices/Predicting_transaction_prices1.ipynb)  Used machine learning algorithms to train several models and determine the best model to predict fair transaction prices of real-estate properties before they are sold.The goal is to come up with a predictive model with a MAE of under $70,000.
    
    -[Regression: Newcomers and Prior Experience] () Built predictive models to study the effects of prior experience on newcomer retention and productivity in Wikipedia.
    
• [Regression: Project popularity on GitHub Used regression models to study which projects are likely to gain popularity on GitHub.
• Determine Customer Loan Eligibility Cleaned data, engineered features, and developed several machine learning models to determine which customer is eligible for loan.

• Long term developers on GitHub Used regression models to identify which developers are likely to continue contributing to a software project on GitHub.
• User Personality in Recommender Systems Used several statistical techniques to explore the relationship between personality and newcomer retention, level of engagement, activity preferences, and distribution of user activity.
• Early Activity and Customer Retention Engineered features based on early user activity and used regression and survival analysis techniques to develop predictive models.
• Employee Retention Studied the employee retention problem by exploring a dataset, cleaning it, engineering new features, recruiting appropriate algorithms, and building an efficient classification model using cross-validation.
• Customer Segmentation Clustered the customers in an online retailer dataset using techniques such as K-Means and PCA.
Regression algorithms used: Linear (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic-Net), Poisson, Negative Binomial (over-dispersed), Random forests Boosted trees, Cox-Proportional Hazards
Classification algorithms used: Decision trees, Logistic (L1-Regularized, L2-Regularized), Random forests, Boosted trees, SVM
Other techniques used: t-test, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-test, ANOVA, PCA, K-Means clustering
